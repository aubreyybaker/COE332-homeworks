# Automotive CO2 Emissions and Fuel Economy Information
The purpose of this project is to query and return interesting information from the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) about the automotive industry’s CO2 emissions and fuel economy. This information is critical to the sustainability of transportation as concerns of climate change and environmental pollution rise.

## Retrieve Data

The user may view the website that the CO2 Emissions and Fuel Economy data comes from using the link below:

```bash
https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/explore-automotive-trends-data#DetailedData
```
The data can be downloaded in ``CSV`` format. Please note that there is not a live link to CSV file, the user must save the file on his/her workspace in the same folder as this project.

## Installation

To begin, make a new folder for this project. An example is shown below:
```console
[user-vm]$ cd ~/coe-332/
[user-vm]$ mkdir redis/
[user-vm]$ cd redis/
[user-vm]$ pwd
/home/ubuntu/coe332/redis
```
Install this project by cloning the repository, making the scripts executable, and adding them to your PATH. For example:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@github.com:alb6443/COE332-homeworks.git <directory>
```
This project lives within the ``homework06`` folder.

## Getting started
### Build a new image via Dockerfile
To start the Flask app, you can find a couple helpful commands below:
```console
[user-vm]$ docker-compose up --build      % Start the services and build the docker image
[user-vm]$ docker ps -a     % Check if image is up
[user-vm]$ docker-compose down      % Kill the services
[user-vm]$ docker ps -a     % Check if image is exited
```
### Pull existing image via Docker Hub
Install this project by pulling the image from Docker Hub. Execute the following lines:
```console
[user-vm]$ docker pull alb6443/auto_trends_app:hw06
[user-vm]$ docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 alb6443/auto_trends_app:hw06
 * Serving Flask app 'auto_trends_app'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 434-637-715
```
You now have access to all of the routes detailed below. For more information, [go to Make a Request section](#make-a-request).

## Understanding the Scripts

This project has one script-- ``autoTrends_app.py`` 

**``autoTrends_app.p``**: This script is a Flask application that has three routes: ``/data``, ``/years``, and ``/years/<year>``. The routes are explained in further detail below:

### Make a Request
Open a separate terminal window for the next step. Make sure the services are up and running with the previously mentioned ``run`` command. To make a request to your Flask app, type the following in the new terminal:

```console
[user-vm]$ curl localhost:5000/data -X POST
```
All of the data from the automotive trends file will populate. To retrieve other data, familiarize yourself with the other routes detailed in the table below:

<table>
<tr>
<td> Route </td> <td> Description and output</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>/data -X POST</code> </td>
<td>

The entire data set will be loaded into the database
```console
data loaded into Redis
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>/data</code> </td>
<td>

A list of all information in the data set will show
